alarm clock with spotify ringtone. some bugs/ui tweaks required. api from developers for spotify website create an app with redirect uri with http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/callback and first for fetching the songs look through the web api and for the playing part u need to have a premium account and have knowledge of the spotify web playback sdk and u can refer from the web playback sdk documentation.(it is a little bit outdated and u have to use a callback function(accepts uri and device id as params) to use an endpoint to play this track with uri as parameter for the song to actually play).the code is actually organized into components which i am proud of.
